										<h2>A. Project Introduction</h2>

										<p>Happy Sunshine is a foodtruck located in 33rd and Arch Street, Philadelphia that serves breakfast sandwiches.</p>

                                        <h2>I. Existing Branding</h2>
										<h3>1. The Menu</h3>

										<li>The existing menu of Happy SunShine foodtruck is very simple, but it conveys a wide range of options for customers. They also provides images of the food on the menu, and we would love to bring that to the Menu on App.</li>

										<h3>2. The Branding</h3>

										<li>The overall branding and identity of Happy Sunshine has a very outstanding light yellow color. The whole foodtruck is filled with yellow while being decorated with multiple stickers on the side.</li>

										<h2>II. Personas and Journey Map</h2>
                                        
                                        <h3>1. Personas</h3>
										<p>Since most of customers are Drexel commuters, especially Drexel students. We decided to have Aidan, a college student in Philadelphia, who usually eats his lunch at Happy Sunshine foodtruck. He will be our potential user because he wants to save time ordering online and picking up at the foodtruck.</p>

                                        <h3>2. Journey Map</h3>
                                        <p>From the Journey Map, the most critical point is that the user wants to have a convenient, quick, but high-quality food on his way to class. Therefore, he decided to order through the App to save more time.</p>

                                    	<li>I was mainly responsible for making the Typography and Branding of Happy Sunshine App. I want to keep the color versions of the existing foodtruck and make it as the main color scheme of the App.</li>

										<h3>1. Typography</h3>

										<li>Poppins font was choosen to be the typography of the Happy Sunshine App.</li>

                                        <li>In our Alpha & Beta project, we first started with redesigning and fixing some errors on the Wireframes in Figma. We set up weekly meetings via Zoom and Teams and use Teams to assign our tasks. After the Alpha Assignment, we learned to adjust our branding and typography to different browser sizes such as Tablet, Phone, and Computer. I am responsible for coding the Receipt, Tracking Order, and View Cart page for 3 versions of browsers.</li>

                                        <h2>II. User Testing</h2>
                                        
                       <li>We also did a lot of user testing throughout the assignment. We conducted interviews with Professor Troy, Jervo, and even other members from other groups. We received some valuable feedbacks, which mainly focused on our icons selection and our log in page. I am responsible for redesigning all the icons and make sure they look all consistent to each other.</li>

                                        	<h3>1. Results</h3>
                        <li>For the final project, since we received feedback from the last meeting in class by Professor Jervo that we should include a Login Page for the Final Project. We started working on the Prototype on Figma very soon, while coding the site at the same time. I am responsible for designing all images on the menu site such as sandwiches, burgers, drinks, sides, and cheesesteaks. </li>

											<h3>2. Conclusion</h3>
                        <li>To sum up, we are very happy with what we have done for the whole term. Personally, I am very satisfied with the icons and images in the menu. Designing the icons definitely takes me the longest time, since I have to reesign it multiple times to make it looks consistent as a whole. However, I am happy with all the feedbacks because it pushes me to try my best overall. </li>
